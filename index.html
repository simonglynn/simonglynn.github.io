				<p><b>We're working hard to change the way ordinary (and extraordinary) Australian households and businesses send and receive parcels.</b></p>
			</section>
			<aside>
				<h1>How?</h1>
<p>We're reinventing the three parts of the delivery process - sending, processing and collecting - to make it easier, cheaper and more convenient to send and receive a parcel.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know more please <a href="#contact" title="Contact">contact us</a>.</p>

				<h1>Households</h1>
<p class="highlight">There used to be a time when a parcel delivery was a rare and special event. But now we receive parcels more frequently than ever before. And with our busy lifestyles, it's no longer convenient to wait for a delivery or be held hostage to a courier delivery window. There has to be a better way. </p>

<ul id="testlist">
<li>What if you could send a parcel as easily as you could send an email on your phone?</li>

<li>What if - whether you were the sender or receiver - you could find out where your parcel was, day or night?</li>

<li>What if you could send or collect your parcel when it was convenient for you, on any day and at any time, not just when it was convenient for the company delivering your parcel?</li>
 
<li>What if you could spend less to send a parcel than you can with the other parcel providers?</li>
  
<li>If all this was possible wouldn't you want to know more?</li>
</ul>
	
<p><b>At DomesticPost we believe this is all possible and we're working hard to bring it to you.</b></p>
				
			</section>
			<section id="businesses">
				<p></p>
				<h1>Businesses</h1>
<p class="highlight">What business hasn't had the experience of a failed delivery to a customer. Or of goods being damaged or lost in transit. Good businesses know that reputation is the key to longevity and parcel delivery is the final - and lasting customer experience that determines whether your business grows or not from the transaction. There has to be a better way to make this experience a positive one for your customers. </p>

<ul id="testlist">
<li>What if your business could reduce the risk of parcel loss and parcel damage?</li>

<li>What if your business could practically eliminate miss-deliveries, theft and fraud?</li>

<li>And what if you could do this for significantly less that it costs you to do it now?</li>

<li>If this was possible wouldn't you want to know more?</li>
</ul>
<p>At DomesticPost we believe there is a better way to help Australian businesses deliver great customer experiences and better their local and international competitors. And we're working hard to bring it to you.</p>
