				<p><b>We're working hard to change the way ordinary (and extraordinary) Australian households and businesses send and receive parcels.</b></p>

				<h1>How?</h1>
<p>We're reinventing the three parts of the delivery process to make it easier, cheaper and more convenient to send and receive a parcel.</p>
<p>And we’re creating a business that recognises that our households are connected to each other and to the businesses that support our needs and lifestyles.</p>

				<h1>Households</h1>
<p class="highlight">There used to be a time when a parcel delivery at home was a rare event. It mostly signalled or punctuated a special day. And when the parcel was opened, inside there was often something to remember fondly, and sometimes, something to be forgotten. </p>

<p>These experiences haven’t changed, but parcel deliveries are no longer rare events for most households. Our households are busier than they’ve ever been and we’ve taken advantage of a bounty of great deals on the Internet that can be purchased from almost anywhere in Australia or the world to be delivered within a few days.</p>

<p>For many of our households, it’s simply not practical to wait for a parcel to be delivered. And when it isn’t delivered successfully and needs to be redelivered or collected, the effort of doing so can leave us annoyed and frustrated.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if we could be in control of our parcel delivery – to know exactly where it is, and when it will arrive? And wouldn’t it be great if we could decide whether to collect our parcel rather than be held hostage to a couriers ‘delivery window’?</p>

<p>When we sent a parcel wouldn’t it be great if it didn’t cost a small fortune, we knew where it was during its journey, and we had confirmation that it arrived in one piece? </p>

<p>There has to be a better way to send and receive parcels. And at DomesticPost we think we know how to do it. </p>

				<h1>Businesses</h1>
<p class="highlight">For businesses – particularly small and medium online shop-fronts – the range of parcel delivery services has never been greater. Yet what business owner doesn’t have a story of a parcel that went missing, or goods that were damaged in transit? </p>

<p>The Internet and parcel delivery services have given businesses greater access than ever before to potential customers. But the online revolution is a double-edged sword. It is now easier than ever before for customers to share a bad experience – whether it is justified or not. </p>

<p>And so every good business knows that to stay in business, service matters, and reputation matters.  </p>

<p>Yet for many businesses there is so much about parcel delivery that is out of their control. Where is the parcel? Has the customer received it in-person or has it been dropped at their door? Is it in good condition? </p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if your business had greater control over a parcel’s journey to your customer – to know that it took as short a route to the customer as possible – with few opportunities for damage? To know that it was safely waiting for your customer, and only your customer, to collect it? To know that when your customer collected it you’d receive confirmation that they had? </p>

<p>And what if you could do this for significantly less than it costs you to do it now?  </p>

<p>There has to be a better way to help Australian businesses compete with their local and international competitors. And at DomesticPost we think we know how to do it. </p>
